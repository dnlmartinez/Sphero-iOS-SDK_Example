# ButtonDrive
This sample code demonstrates sending Sphero roll commands.  4 buttons on the UI will allow you to
send Sphero roll commands at 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees.  The stop button in the middle will stop
Sphero.

The roll command 
takes a heading from 0째 to 360째, and a relative speed from 0.0 to 1.0. So, to command the ball to go 90째 at half speed would be:

     [RKRollCommand sendCommandWithHeading:90.0 velocity:0.5];

The ball is stopped with `[RKRollCommand sendStop]`.

Also, demonstrated in the code is the use of RUICalibrateGestureHandler which is attached to a view in it's initWithView: method. Calibration is used by the user to aim Sphero in a direction that they consider forward and sets the 0째 heading in that direction. This gesture uses two fingers to rotate the ball similar to using two using the two finger rotation gesture used to rotate a photo.
